## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
- Author a backlog-ready spec/issue → invoke /spec

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Testing
Backend (Java 21/Spring Boot, Maven): `cd backend && ./mvnw test` — requires
`JAVA_HOME` pointed at a JDK 21+ install (see README's "One-time local setup").
Frontend (React/TypeScript, Vite): `cd frontend && npm test` (Vitest + React
Testing Library). See TESTING.md for conventions and layers.

- 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe.
- When writing new functions, write a corresponding test.
- When fixing a bug, write a regression test.
- When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error.
- When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for both paths.
- Never commit code that makes existing tests fail.
